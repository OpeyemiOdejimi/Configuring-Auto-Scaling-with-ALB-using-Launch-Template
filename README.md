# Mini Project Understanding: Shell Scripting + Cloud Integration
## What I Understand the Requirement To Be:
The goal of this mini project is to combine foundational shell scripting concepts with practical AWS cloud usage to simulate a real-world automation task. The client (a data-focused e-commerce startup) wants to automatically provision infrastructure on AWS to support data science activities like analysis of customer behavior.

To help with that, I’m expected to write a shell script that:

Creates EC2 instances (used for computation and running workloads)

Creates and configures S3 buckets (for storing large datasets)

But beyond just doing those tasks, the script must demonstrate mastery of 5 essential shell scripting skills:

## Key Concepts I Must Apply in the Script:
Functions:

Break the script into reusable blocks like create_ec2_instance or create_s3_bucket

This helps in maintaining and reusing code

Arrays:

Store created resources like EC2 instance IDs or bucket names in an array

This makes it easy to manage or loop through resources later

Environment Variables:

Use variables like $AWS_REGION, $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, etc.

This keeps the script secure and flexible (so it works in different environments)

Command Line Arguments:

Allow users to customize what they want by passing values like:

bash
Copy
Edit
./deploy.sh t2.micro my-data-bucket
These arguments can set things like instance type or bucket names dynamically

## Error Handling:

Include if statements to check if a command failed using $?

For example, if creating a bucket fails, show a message or retry

This ensures the script doesn't break silently and is more reliable

## My Overall Understanding
This project simulates how real companies use automation scripts to deploy cloud infrastructure. It's not just about being able to use AWS CLI — it’s about using shell scripting best practices to make scripts modular, secure, dynamic, and fault-tolerant.

I see this as a preparation stage: I need to show that I understand the expectations before diving into writing the actual script in the next project.
